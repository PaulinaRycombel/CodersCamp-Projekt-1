# CodersCamp-Projekt-1
# Project

This project is a portfolio website made by Paulina Rycombel.

# Flexbox
Flexbox was implemented in every section of the code. Bootstrap was not used, however, the website is still quite responsive due to flexbox.


## Keyframes animation

Used in hero section for button and h3 title, also hover animation for navigation items.

## Fonts and Icons

I used two different sans-serif fonts from Google Fonts, as well as icons for skills section.

## Box model
I tried to use the box model in every section of the code, since it was the most readable way for me to arrange sections and items on the website.

## Colors
Different ways of color notations were used throughout the code - rgb, hex, simple color name.
